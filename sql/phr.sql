/*
  The claims crawler will create an entry in this table for each new plan that it comes across while crawling for a user's claims.
  For people who do not understand it, the word plan is used to describe the various kinds of plans that insurers offer. Plans have
  different characteristics such as different individual and family deductibles, different copays for RX, different co-insurance etc.
  
  The plan information can be scraped by visiting the "View Plan Summary" link on the home page. The member number and group number
  need to be populated in teh user_has_these_ehrs table and not in the plan_entities table.

  Generally the term copay is used for a fixed payment that a consumer must make when visiting a doctor or buying a drug. Someplans only
  have a copay. Increasingly many plans have a co-insurance as well on top of the copy. The co-insurance is typically a percentage value.
  Several attributes below are named as copayPercentage... etc. when they should actually be coinsurancePercentage.... etc. The Blue Shield
  of CA website calls them as such and I have tried to keep things simple.

  Here are the definitions of the various components:
     1.  copayPercentageOfficeVisits:  This is the co-insurance percentage for office visits and is typically ranges from 10-30%
     2.  copayPercentageForGenericRX:  This is the co-insurance percentage for Generic drugs
     3.  copayPercentageForBrandedRX:  This is the co-insurance percentage for Brandex drugs
     4.  copayPercentageforNonFormularyRX: A formulary is the list of drugs that are supported by a health plan. Non-formulary drugs 
                                           have higher copays and co-insurance.
     5.  maxCopayForInNetworkProviders: Most plans have an upper limit for the total amount of co-pay and co-insurance a consumer must bear.
                                        This value is for seeing in-network providers. Think of this as a maximum out of pocket (OOP) that a
                                        consumer might bear. There is a separate max value for out-of-network providers (below).
     6.  maxCopayForOutNetworkProviders: Maximum OOP for out-of-network providers 
     7.  maxDeductibleForInNetworkProviders: A deductible is an amount that the consumer must bear before the insurance kicks in (or before the
                                             co-insurance kicks in. This is the maximum deductible that a consumer must bear for seeing
                                             in-network providers. A deductible is upfront cost. The OOP above includes both the deductible and
                                             the co-insurance.
     8.  maxDeductibleForOutNetworkProviders: Deductible for seeing out-of-network providers
     9.  inNetworkDeductibleUsed: This is the current value of the deductible that the consumer has incurred out of the maxmimum deductible for in-network. 
                                  This will not be scraped presently because the Blue Shield of CA website does not provide this.
    10.  outOfNetworkDeductibleUsed: This is the current value of the deductible that a consumer has incurred for seeing out-of-network providers.
                                     This will not be scraped presently because the Blue Shield of CA website does not provide this.
    11.  maxInNetworkOOPUsed: This is the current value of the OOP incurred by a consumer for seeing in-network providers. This will not be scraped presently
                              because the Blue Shield of CA website does not provide this.
    12.  maxOutOfNetworkOOPUsed: This is the current value of the OOP incurred by a consumer for seeing out-of-network providers. This will not be scraped presently
                                 because the Blue Shield of CA website does not provide this.

  This is a tricky table to populate.

  I am currently assuming that there are two types of records to be populated in this table - "imaging" and "labs".

  The data that is captured for each of these record types is different and I have modelled it by having different attributes
  in this table but appropriately setting the testType enum.

  Question: how do we distinguish which test type is "lab" and which is "imaging"? 
  Answer: Normally this will be done by having a pre-populated table of all imaging and lab tests and matching the test name
          against this table. For now, we will indeed have this table called "labOrImaging" that will be populated with just
          the names of imaging tests that were done on Evan. If the tests match those then they will be imaging tests else 
          lab tests.

  For lab tests the following fields will be populated by crawling each test component. Notice that for each test component multiple
  records might be created because the EHR system records some details in a crazy way. I will explain later.
         1.  testComponentName
         2.  userValue of the test component

      3. reasonForVisit: Populate this with the value of the "Reason For Visit" on the details page
      4. visitType: will have the value of "Visit Type" on the details page
      5. referrals will be populated with the value of 'Y' if the details page has any referrals under "Tests and/or treatments prescribed during the visit" as
         is the case on the details page for the visit corresponding to visit on December 19, 2011 with Catherine Marie Chin-Garcia. Records
         will be added to the "user_visit_referrals" table as well.
      6. vitals will be populated with the value of 'Y' if the "Vitals" section shows up on the details page as is the case on the details page for the 
         visit corresponding to visit on December 19, 2011 with Catherine Marie Chin-Garcia. Records will be added to the "user_visit_vitals" table as well.
      7. testsOrdered will have a value of 'Y' if the "Future Orders" section shows up on the details page as as is the case on the details page for the 
         visit corresponding to visit on December 19, 2011 with Catherine Marie Chin-Garcia. Records will be added to the "user_visit_tests" table as well.

         The thing that I really want to achieve is to also set up the relationship between the records in the "user_tests" table and tie them to the tests ordered
         during the visit. You can figure out how to do that or leave the "userTestId" field in the "user_visit_tests" table as NULL.
